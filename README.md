# VCX

This is a work in progress project with the eventual goal of providing simple personal version control.

## What is version control?
Imagine if every time you edited a document, designed a graphic, or updated a spreadsheet, a tiny snapshot was taken automatically.

You could scroll back to yesterday’s version.
Or last week’s version.
Or the version you edited right before something broke.

You can view changes, roll back mistakes, compare versions, and branch off to explore alternative ideas — all without making duplicate files.

It’s like track changes, undo, auto-save, backup, and organization — all working together.

That’s version control.
A time machine for your work.
